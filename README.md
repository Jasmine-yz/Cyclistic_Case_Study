# Cyclistic_Case_Study
## ASK
### Business Task: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## PREPARE
### Data Sources
I will be using Cyclistic historical trip data from Jan,2023 to Dec,2023, which can be downloaded [HERE](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [lisence](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders'personally identiable information. This means that you won't be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

The data is stored in spreadsheets in a total of 12 .csv files
